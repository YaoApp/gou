### Yao Runtime

Yao Runtime is a server-side execution environment for running processes.

- **Internal Processes** written in Go, executed directly.
- **Custom Processes** written in TypeScript or JavaScript, executed using the V8 engine. Yao provides APIs like `Process`, `File System`, and `HTTP Request` to write these processes.

**Note**: **Yao Runtime is not Node.js**. It's specifically for running processes and does not support Node.js APIs.
