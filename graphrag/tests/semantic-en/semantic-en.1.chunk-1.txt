- **For Machine**: We aim to make the code AI-friendly, easy to generate, and simple to extend

In Yao, we use a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to describe widgets, assemble them into applications, and use processes for atomic functions

Yao widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.
Yao DSL is an intermediate language understandable by both humans and machines. It can be generated by AI, created via GUI, or written manually, with seamless switching between approaches.
Use the Yao runtime to execute the code, and its built-in HTTP server to serve the application
