**3. AI Generation First, Then Manual Modification**

The fastest way to create a widget is by using AI to generate the DSL, which you can then manually tweak to fit your needs.

For example:

- Provide a Model DSL to the AI, specify your requirements, and let the AI generate a similar one. You can then adjust it as needed.
- You can also provide both a Model DSL and a Table DSL to the AI, allowing it to generate a Table widget DSL that binds to the Mod
generate a Table widget DSL that binds to the Model. Adjust it as necessary.

The Yao Playground repository offers a simple tool for generating DSLs, which you can use. Alternatively, you can develop your own tool for this purpose.
