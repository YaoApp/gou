### Yao Widget

A Widget in Yao is not just a traditional frontend component; it is a combination of UI, interaction, logic, and data. There are no frontend and backend concepts in a Widget; it is a self-contained unit.
A widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.
Each Widget has a set of Processes, and some Widgets have a set of REST APIs. It can be used in other widgets, custom processes, or integrated into other applications.
A Widget is described using DSL, which is in JSON format. It can be generated by AI, created via a GUI, or written manually.
