### Yao Widget

A Widget in Yao is not just a traditional frontend component; it is a combination of UI, interaction, logic, and data. There are no frontend and backend concepts in a Widget; it is a self-contained unit.
A widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.
