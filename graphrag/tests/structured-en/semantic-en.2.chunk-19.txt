A Process in Yao is an atomic function that runs in the Yao Runtime.

Yao provides hundreds of internal processes with diverse functionalities. You can also create custom processes in TypeScript or JavaScript.

- **Custom Process**: Written in TypeScript or JavaScript, located in the `scripts` directory of your project.
- **GRPC Plugin**: Written in any language, located in the `plugins` directory of your project.
