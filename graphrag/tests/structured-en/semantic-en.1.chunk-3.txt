` is the command to start the application server. In **development mode**, Yao watches changes to the DSL and Process files and automatically reloads the application server.

`yao run` is the command to run a process. You can use it to test the process before integrating it into the application.

**Visual Studio Code** is the recommended IDE for developing Yao applications. set the `.yao` file type to `jsonc` in the settings, you can get the syntax highlighting and auto-completion.

## Tips for switching to Yao

Yao is a new way of building web applications. Here are some tips to help you switch to Yao.

**1. The Best Way to Learn: Practice and Read Source Code**

The best way to learn is through hands-on practice. Follow the documentation to build a simple application and explore the basics.

You can also read the application source code, to see how the widgets are described and how the processes are written.

Here ase some repositories you can refer to:

**2. Planning Before Starting Development**

In Yao, the data model is crucial. When beginning development, it's essential to plan the data structure and relationships.

When starting a new project, define the data model in the `models` directory first. Then, create the Table, Form, and API widgets based on this model.

Preparing test data and creating an import process is a good practice, as it enhances development efficiency. When deploying the application, you can use this process to import demo data.

You can generate test data using AI by sending the Model DSL to the AI and asking it to ge
