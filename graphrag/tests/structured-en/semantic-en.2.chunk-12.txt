Preparing test data and creating an import process is a good practice, as it enhances development efficiency. When deploying the application, you can use this process to import demo data.

You can generate test data using AI by sending the Model DSL to the AI and asking it to generate the data.

**3. AI Generation First, Then Manual Modification**

The fastest way to create a widget is by using AI to generate the DSL, which you can then manually tweak to fit your needs.
